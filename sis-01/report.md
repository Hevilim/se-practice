# SIS #01 — Software Engineering Fundamentals, With an AI in the Loop

<!--
  This is the only file you write your report in. README.md tells you what goes where.

  Rules the checker relies on:
  - Do not delete, rename or renumber the ## headings, the ### headings, or the **Label:** words.
  - Replace every "(write here)" and "(paste here)". None may be left when you submit.
  - Comments like this one are ignored by the word counter. Delete them or leave them.

**Topic:** 1.1

<!-- Exactly one of 1.1 … 1.10, e.g.  **Topic:** 1.4  -->

## 1. Scenario

<!-- 100–150 words, labels included. One small scenario, used in every prompt and in your
     whole answer. Anything fictional is labelled in Assumptions. -->

**Question:** When we give the Smart Campus room booking system to the university, what does the customer need besides the program code?

**Users:** Students who book study rooms, and one administrator who blocks rooms and checks room use.

**Problem:** The booking function works and passes its tests. But the university must install the system, teach people to use it and fix it later. Code alone does not help them do this.

**Constraints:** The team is two students with four weeks. After delivery the university IT staff, not the team, must support the system.

**Risk:** Someone changes the booking rules later, nobody runs the tests, and two students get the same room at the same time.

**Assumptions:** The university, the team size, the four weeks and the IT staff are fictional. The booking rules come from my week-05 lab.

## 2. Analysis

<!-- 350–400 words. Your answer to the question, the trade-offs, and how it applies to your
     scenario. Explain at least two engineering decisions and why they fit the scenario. -->

(write here)

## 3. Review

<!-- 250–300 words. What Prompt B's critique said and what you did with it; your two source
     checks and your two substantive revisions, each with a reason. Point at the rows of the
     tables in section 9 ("verification row 2", "change-log row 1"). -->

(write here)

## 4. Conclusion

<!-- 100–150 words. Your recommendation for the scenario and its main limitation. -->

(write here)

## 5. Reflection

<!-- 150–200 words. NOT part of the main total. Written by you, not by the assistant:
     what helped, what you changed, what you learned. Specific beats flattering. -->

(write here)

## 6. References

<!-- Full references, one per line, each starting with "- ". Only sources you actually opened.
     Every URL used in the verification table must also appear here. Example:
     - Sommerville, I. (2016). Software Engineering, 10th ed., Global Edition. Pearson. Ch. 1.

## 7. Appendix A — Initial outline

<!-- Written BEFORE you run Prompt A. Five points, your own words, numbered. These are the
     "five points" you paste into Prompt A. -->

1. The university needs a server or cloud, the needed software (database, web server), and a simple step-by-step installation guide.
2. Students need a login and a short user guide, and the admin needs an admin account and an admin guide.
3. The university can test the main tasks with real users and check that every requirement works, and the system should show errors in logs.
4. The IT team needs the full source code on GitHub, a README on how to run it, and technical documentation about the structure and database.
5. Security of student data, user training, and clear documentation are as important as the code, because without them the system is hard to use and hard to support.

## 8. Appendix B — AI exchanges

<!-- Complete prompts and complete responses, as text — never screenshots. Paste each inside
     the fenced block that follows its label. If a response itself contains ``` lines, open
     and close that block with ~~~~ instead. You may add B4, B5 … after B3 if you ran more. -->

### B1 — Draft (Prompt A)

- **Tool:** (write here)
- **Model:** (write here)
- **Date:** (write here)
- **Purpose:** contextual draft

<!-- Model: the exact model with its version, as the tool shows it (e.g. "GPT-5 Thinking",
     "Claude Sonnet 4.5"). If the tool does not show it, write: not displayed
     Date: YYYY-MM-DD -->

**Prompt:**

```text

```

**Response:**

```text

```

### B2 — Critique (Prompt B)

- **Model:** (write here)
- **Date:** (write here)
- **Purpose:** critical review of the draft

**Prompt:**

```text

```

### B3 — Revision (Prompt C)

- **Tool:** (write here)
- **Model:** (write here)
- **Date:** (write here)
- **Purpose:** revision using my decisions and verified evidence

**Prompt:**

```text

```

**Response:**

```text

```

## 9. Appendix C — Evidence tables

### Verification table

<!-- At least two complete rows. Source and locator: title + page / slide / section / chapter,
     or title + URL + access date (YYYY-MM-DD). Decision: keep, qualify or reject — one word. -->

| AI claim | Source and locator | Evidence found | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

### Change log

<!-- At least two substantive revisions. Your final version must differ from the AI wording,
     and the reason must say which evidence or scenario constraint made you change it. -->

| AI wording / suggestion | Your final version | Reason for change |
